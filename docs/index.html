## **XGeoff**
<p><em>Technologist, Storyteller, Explorer of Systems—both real and imagined.</em></p>
<hr />
</div>
### 👋 **Call me Jefe, GP or just G.**
<p>I’ve spent my life navigating the edges where technology, creativity, and curiosity meet. I’m a <strong>software architect</strong> and <strong>tech leader</strong> with a love for building elegant systems. Not just software systems, but narrative systems, artistic systems, human systems. The kind that shape how we interact with each other—and with the future.</p>
<p>You could say I have a <strong>360° view of software</strong>: I’ve been the guy fixing production bugs at 2 a.m., the one leading teams through architectural overhauls, and the person in the room when early startups decide what to build first. I’ve worked in tech support, product strategy, engineering, and executive leadership. It gives me perspective. And empathy.</p>
<p>But I’ve never stopped making things with my own hands.</p>
<p>I still code, because I love it. I write stories that stretch across galaxies and timelines. I generate digital art using AI tools, sometimes to explore world-building ideas, sometimes just because it feels right. I take photos on long walks—of moments, patterns, and the stillness in between. I’ve spent years on the road, from Tokyo to Lisbon to little towns with names you forget but memories you don’t.</p>
<p>This page isn’t a pitch. It’s a handshake. A hello. If you're here, maybe you’re curious too.</p>
<hr />
<h3>🛠️ <strong>Things I Build</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Platforms &amp; Tools</strong> – Architected backend systems and API gateways used by millions</li>
<li><strong>Developer Runtimes</strong> – Built interpreters and compilers, just for the love of it</li>
<li><strong>Startups</strong> – Helped launch and scale several early-stage companies</li>
<li><strong>AI Experiments</strong> – Explored what happens when code learns to imagine</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>✍️ <strong>Things I Write</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Luminethra</em> – A mythic Warhammer 40k saga of fate, storms, and survival</li>
<li><em>The Way of the Gun</em> – A Star Wars Western where blasters echo in the dust</li>
<li><em>The Reach</em> – A surreal Americana ghost story about WRCH, a forgotten radio station</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Software as Narrative</strong>
Code is language. Language is pattern. I write systems that tell stories, and stories that explore systems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>🎨 <strong>Things I See</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Photography</strong> – I chase texture, light, and symmetry in overlooked places</li>
<li><strong>Digital Art</strong> – AI-generated scenes of quiet futures and impossible histories</li>
<li><strong>Design</strong> – Interfaces that don’t just work—but <em>feel</em> right</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>🌍 <strong>Where I’ve Been</strong></h3>
<p>Consulting took me around the world. Startups taught me how to move fast and fix things. Big tech taught me how to think in layers and scale with intention.</p>
<p>What I carry with me:</p>
<ul>
<li>The startup spark that says, <em>what if we just tried it this way?</em></li>
<li>The engineer’s eye for detail and flow</li>
<li>The traveler’s instinct to listen before speaking</li>
<li>The writer’s belief that every system tells a story</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>🧭 <strong>What Drives Me</strong></h3>
<p>Curiosity. Craft. Connection. Whether it’s code, a photograph, or a short story, I’m after that moment when everything just clicks. When structure meets soul.</p>
