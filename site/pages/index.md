## **X Geoff**

*Technologist, Software Architect, World Traveller and Sci-Fi Enthusiast*
I’m a software architect, developer, and technologist with over two decades of experience designing and guiding complex software systems. I’ve worked across industries and teams, solving challenging technical problems and shaping systems built to last. My focus has always been on making technology practical and scalable, and on creating environments where good ideas turn into real results.
Beyond work, I love exploring the world through travel, food, and photography. I also feed my creative side through reading science fiction, writing, and using AI-assisted art to bring ideas to life.
At heart, I’m a creator — whether it’s software, stories, or memories from time spent in new places.

### **Projects**

* *Luminethra* – A mythic Warhammer 40k saga of fate, storms, and survival
* *Chronicles of the Old Republic* – Sweeping Star Wars narratives of ambition, faith, 
    and war in the dawn age of the Galactic Republic, when Jedi, Sith, and empires first 
    shaped the fate of the galaxy
* *The Reach* – A surreal Americana ghost story about WRCH, a forgotten radio station
* *ClearHealth* – A healthcare concept connecting patients, providers, and payers
    with transparent, value-based care
* *Arden* – A constructed language designed for clarity, expressiveness, and ease of use
* *Grimoire* – A static site generator built as a Gradle plugin,
    leveraging Handlebars and Groovy for flexible, scriptable content creation
* *Glyph* - statically typed, WASM-first programming language that blends the clean syntax 
    of Groovy and Kotlin with systems-level performance, compiling into a single efficient 
    .wasm or JVM target for cloud, serverless, and edge computing
* *TetraFamilia* - an interwoven saga of four lineages whose descendants, bound by memory 
    and rivalry, navigate two millennia of shifting empires, faiths, and ideologies from 
    antiquity to the Cold War
* *The Moirad* - this prequel to the Iliad tells of how gods and mortals, bound by pride and 
    desire, set in motion the fated war that would bring mighty Troy to ruin. Told in the 
    epic Homeric style
