## **Jefe**

*Technologist, Software Architect, World Traveller and Sci-Fi Enthusiast*


I’m an experienced software architect, developer, and technologist with more than two decades of building and guiding software systems. Over the years, I’ve had the chance to work across industries and teams, solving tough technical problems and helping shape systems that are built to last. My focus has always been on making technology practical and scalable, and on creating an environment where good ideas can turn into real results.

Beyond my professional life, I’ve always been curious about the world. I enjoy traveling and experiencing different cultures, especially through food and the small details that make each place unique. That sense of exploration carries over into my creative side as well. I spend time writing and experimenting with AI-assisted art, not because I’m chasing mastery but because I enjoy the process of discovering new ways to express ideas.

At the heart of it, I see myself as someone who likes to build — whether it’s software, stories, or memories from time spent in new places.



I’ve spent my career in a variety of different roles related to various aspects of software development. I like to say I have a **360° view of what it takes to design, develop, and deliver quality software at scale**. Currently I’m a **software architect** and **tech leader** with a love for building elegant systems.

I still code, because I enjoy it and because I have a passion for the details when it comes to software. 

My personal pursuits and interests include science fiction, AI Art and travel. I am working on some stories in the Star Wars and Warhammer 40k universes. I use Midjourney to generate digital art, and it has expanded and given form to my imagination in a way I previously would have never thought possible. I take photos on long walks—of moments, patterns, and the stillness in between. I’ve spent years on the road, from Tokyo to Lisbon to little towns with names you forget but memories you don’t.

This page isn’t a pitch. It’s a handshake. A hello. If you're here, maybe you’re curious too.


### 🛠️ **Projects**

* **Platforms & Tools** – Architected backend systems and API gateways used by millions
* **Developer Runtimes** – Built interpreters and compilers, just for the love of it
* **Startups** – Helped launch and scale several early-stage companies
* **AI Experiments** – Explored what happens when code learns to imagine


### ✍️ **Things I Write**

* **Science Fiction & Fantasy**

    * *Luminethra* – A mythic Warhammer 40k saga of fate, storms, and survival
    * *The Way of the Gun* – A Star Wars Western where blasters echo in the dust
    * *The Reach* – A surreal Americana ghost story about WRCH, a forgotten radio station

* **Software as Narrative**
  Code is language. Language is pattern. I write systems that tell stories, and stories that explore systems.


### 🎨 **Things I See**

* **Photography** – I chase texture, light, and symmetry in overlooked places
* **Digital Art** – AI-generated scenes of quiet futures and impossible histories
* **Design** – Interfaces that don’t just work—but *feel* right


### 🌍 **Where I’ve Been**

Consulting took me around the world. Startups taught me how to move fast and fix things. Big tech taught me how to think in layers and scale with intention.

What I carry with me:

* The startup spark that says, *what if we just tried it this way?*
* The engineer’s eye for detail and flow
* The traveler’s instinct to listen before speaking
* The writer’s belief that every system tells a story


### 🧭 **What Drives Me**

Curiosity. Craft. Connection. Whether it’s code, a photograph, or a short story, I’m after that moment when everything just clicks. When structure meets soul.
